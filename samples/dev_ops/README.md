# DevOps

## Summary

Keep your team in sync with the <b>DevOps card</b>. This card provides a clear snapshot of a pull request’s status—merged, open, or in review—along with a concise description, activity highlights like comments and file changes, and contributor details. A dedicated button lets users jump straight to the full request, making it easy to stay on top of code changes and collaboration.

## 1) 👩‍🎨 Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‘Open in Designer’</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.


_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

 <br>

#### 2) Update Main Heading & Description Text

Update the header, item number and body copy to pull from the desired pull request.

#### 3) Status Badge

Change the "Merged" label and its style (e.g., "Accent") to reflect the current status of the pull request (e.g., "Open", "Draft", "Closed").

#### 4) User & Commit Info

Replace "Serena Davis" and "EdSims" with the actual contributor and source branch or user. Update the commit count as needed.

#### 5) Review Summary

Adjust the numbers for reviewers, comments, and files changed to match the actual pull request data.

#### 6) Action Button

Ensure the "View pull request" button is linked to the correct URL for the partner's GitHub or Azure DevOps instance.
