#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints.

* For YouTube, Vimeo, and DailyMotion Inline Media Cards, the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button will not need to be added.
* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action.
* <b>Note:</b> A radius feature for adding rounded corners to the image is coming soon. In the meantime, you can manually add a 6px radius to the corners.

#### 3) Replace the Author/Company Logo

Replace the mini 16x16px square image. If creating a new image, save it as a transparent PNG at 2x size (keeping the 16x16 fixed width).

#### 4) Update the description copy and set truncation

Set the maximum line truncation as desired. You can choose to keep or remove the ‚ÄúShow more‚Äù / ‚ÄúShow less‚Äù feature.

#### 5) Update Button Copy and Actions

* Customize button text and actions to suit your needs. <br>
For icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in light/dark modes. Icons should fit edge-to-edge in a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for good resolution across endpoints. Access Fluent icon asset links in the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page.

<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/video_spec.png">(detailed spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

<br>

## 2) üöó Test your card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)

<br>
