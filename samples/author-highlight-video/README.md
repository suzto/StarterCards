*To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON.* <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
    "width": "full"
  },
```


<!--- button image exported at 1.2x --->
<a href="https://adaptivecards.io/designer?card=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsuzto%2FStarterCards%2Fmain%2Fsamples%2Fauthor-highlight-video%2Fcard.json" target="_blank">
  <img src="../../assets/open_designer_button.png" width="190" alt="Open in Adaptive Card Designer" />
</a>



#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints.

* For YouTube, Vimeo, and DailyMotion Inline Media Cards, the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button will not need to be added.
* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action.
* <b>Note:</b> A radius feature for adding rounded corners to the image is coming soon. In the meantime, you can manually add a 6px radius to the corners.

#### 3) Update Video Information

Modify the details or statistics as desired.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and add or remove actions to suit your needs. <br>
For icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in light/dark modes. Icons should fit edge-to-edge in a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for good resolution across endpoints. Access Fluent icon asset links in the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page.

<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/video_spec.png">(see current card spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

<br>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)
